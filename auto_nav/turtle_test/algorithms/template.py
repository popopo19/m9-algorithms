# Sample Algorithm

# Some functions for turtle movement
# drone.left(n) - Turn left n degrees. There's also right.
# drone.forward(n) - Go forward n amount. There's also backwards.
# drone.goto(x, y) - Go to position (x, y)

# Keep the speed of the drone at 1
# However, if you want to change it, to change it is drone.speed(#)
# If you change the speed, remember to record that in record.csv

import turtle

def auto_nav(drone, pylon1, pylon2):
	pass

# GOOD LUCK
